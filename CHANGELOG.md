## [Unreleased]

The first Windows version, with the features of Aktar for Mac 0.4.1.

### Added

- Upload panel in the notification area: drag & drop, clipboard paste (files
  copied in File Explorer, or images), or file picker
- Global "paste & upload" shortcut (default Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U), customizable
  in Settings > General
- Bring-your-own S3-compatible storage (Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2,
  DigitalOcean Spaces, MinIO, or any other S3-compatible endpoint), with
  credentials kept in Windows Credential Manager
- "Use path-style addressing" for S3-compatible servers without a
  subdomain per bucket
- Multiple destinations, switchable per upload
- Upload progress, and cancelling or removing uploads from the panel and
  the Library
- Upload history with search, thumbnails, and previews (images, PDFs, text,
  Markdown)
- Copy link as URL, Markdown, HTML, or a custom template
- Bucket browser in the Library window: browse each destination's bucket
  folder by folder, search the whole bucket, preview files, copy links or
  temporary links, upload into a folder, create folders, rename or move
  files, and delete them
- Raycast integration: the same opt-in local API as the Mac app (127.0.0.1
  only, token-protected), and `aktar://` links (`upload-clipboard`,
  `library`, `settings`, `connect`)
- Expiring uploads: "Delete after" 1, 7, 14, or 30 days next to the
  destination picker, available once the destination's bucket has Aktar's
  lifecycle rules (set up from the picker or the destination's settings,
  keeping the bucket's other rules exactly as they are, including ones like
  R2's default multipart rule). They go under `tmp/{N}d/` and the bucket
  deletes them. "Turn Off..." in the destination's settings stops offering
  it, optionally removing Aktar's rules from the bucket. The local API takes
  `expires=`
- Automatic updates from GitHub releases, verified before installing, and
  installed while Aktar isn't in use
- Launch at sign-in
- A Microsoft Store (MSIX) package alongside the installer, updated by the
  Store
- English, Turkish, German, French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese,
  and Simplified Chinese. The language can be changed in Settings without
  restarting
